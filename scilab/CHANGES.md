New features
------------

For a high-level description of the main new features of this release, please consult the the "What's new" page of the help, by simply typing `help` in the Scilab console.

In summary, the main new features and additions are:

### Scilab 2024.1.0

#### New functions

- `uiimport()`: GUI facilitating the import data from CSV or TXT file.
- `scilab()` runs another Scilab in interactive or batch mode with command line options.
- `colormap()`: sets and/or gets a figure colormap.
- `bezier()`: computes the points of a Bezier curve using `bernstein()` matrix.
- `princomp()` now returns the variance percentage and the estimated mean of each variable of input.
- [Predefined colormaps][4] function helpers have been added to generate different types of [colormaps][5].

[5]: https://help.scilab.org/colormaps

#### Language changes

- New helpers have been added for `arguments` block: `mustBeSquare`, `mustBeEqualDimsOrScalar`.

### Display

- Type and Dimensions of variables are now displayed in command line output.

#### Performances

- Some Scilab modules (`Statistics`, `Elementary functions`, ...) have been updated to use the `arguments` block hence enhancing their performances.
- Sparse matrix concatenation and product operations have been speedup (See #17183).

#### Web tools

- Headers added as optional output arguments to `http_*` functions.

### Scilab 2024.0.0

#### New functions

- Timeseries introduces a large set of functions and features to simplify the management of timed data and data tables in Scilab.
- `cvode()`, `arkode()`, `ida()` and `kinsol()` from [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials).
- `compress()` and `decompress()` functions manage compressed archives (ZIP, tar.gz and tar.xz files).
- `angle()` computes the argument of complex numbers, in radians.

#### Language changes

- `arguments/end` keywords added: validate function input arguments in a standard way (using standard error messages) and faster than using Scilab code (`type`, `typeof`, ...).
  Some helpers have been added for this new block: `mustBeSameType`, `mustBeEqualDimsOrScalar`, ...
  Some Scilab functions (`modulo`, `pmodulo`, ...) and modules (`time`, ...) have been updated to use this new block hence enhancing their performances.
- `select/case` supports multiple cases with `cells`.
- When calling a function or extracting values, it is possible to skip an output argument. If a variable is named `_` the output value will not be assigned (e.g. `[r1, _, r3,...] = func(...)`).

#### Web tools

- Use `curl` as default in `atomsDownload()` for all OS to handle local file repositories.
- `url_encode()` and `url_decode()` are added.
- Headers added as optional input arguments to `http_*` functions.
- Cookie management added to webtools module.

#### Graphics

- New marker types added for graphic objects:
  - triangles pointing to data: upward, downward, left, right,
  - horizontal line (minus sign) centred on data,
  - vertical line centred on data.
- `errbar()` function uses horizontal line marks.
- `subplot()` manages `frame` uicontrols.

#### Differential equations

- Several features added to `cvode()`, `arkode()`, `ida()` and `kinsol()` through optional arguments (`cvode()` and `ida()` have specific sensitivity features).
- Absolute and relative numerical tolerances added to `intl()` input arguments.

#### Sparse matrices

- [ColPack](https://github.com/CSCsw/ColPack) graph colouring algorithms for sparse Jacobian computation have been integrated.

#### String

- `strsubst()` manages group in replacement.
- `string()` accepts `lists`, `cells` and `structs`.

Obsolete functions or features
------------------------------

### Scilab 2024.1.0

All these functions and features will be removed in Scilab 2026.0.0 (October 2025):

- `dassl()`, `dasrt()` and `daskr()` are now internal functions: Please use `dae()` instead.
- Colormap functions (`autumncolormap()`, `bonecolormap()`, `coolcolormap()`, `coppercolormap()`, `graycolormap()`, `hotcolormap()`, `hsvcolormap()`, `jetcolormap()`, `oceancolormap()`, `parulacolormap()`, `pinkcolormap()`, `rainbowcolormap()`, `springcolormap()`, `summercolormap()`, `whitecolormap()`, `wintercolormap()`) have been renamed without `colormap` suffix, so `autumncolormap()` became `autumn()`, ...
  
### Scilab 2024.0.0

All these functions and features will be removed in Scilab 2025.0.0 (October 2024):

- `splitURL()`: Please use `url_split()` instead.
- `getURL()`: Please use `http_get()` instead.
- `sound()`: Please use `playsnd()` instead.
