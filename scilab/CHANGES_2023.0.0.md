New features
------------

For a high-level description of the main new features of this release, please consult the [embedded help][4]. It is also available as the "What's new" page of the help, by simply typing `help` in Scilab console.

[4]: modules/helptools/data/pages/homepage-en_US.html

In summary, the main new features and additions are:
* `axes.auto_stretch` property added.
* `http_get()` function now sets `accept-encoding` flag.
* Optional `verbose` parameter added to `http_get()`.
* `atomsInstall()` will now try to build a package (containing only Scilab code) locally from sources when no compatible binary version is found.
* Polynomial exponent display can either use ascii or unicode, and is configurable through preferences (See issue #16871).
* `toJSON(var, filename, indent)` implemented, after `toJSON(var, filename)`.
* `fromJSON` and `toJSON` processing of `tab` (`ascii(9)`) is changed.
* `for c = h,.., end` now accepts an hypermatrix `h` and iterates over its columns `matrix(h, size(h,1),-1)`.
* When an operation fails due to mismatching sizes of operands, the sizes are now displayed in the message.
* Displaying `covWrite("html", dir)` results is improved.
* `tbx_make(".", "localization")` can now update files of translated messages according to new gettext entries in the code.

Removed Features
----------------

The following features and usages have been removed or disabled:

Installation
------------

* macOS
   - Scilab now includes an embedded JRE and won't require a system installed JDK at run-time (See issue #13087).


Compilation
-----------

* GNU autotools have been updated to :
   - automake (GNU automake) 1.16.5
   - autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.71
   
* All builds require a C++17 compiler. Toolboxes might also want to use this standard by specifying `-std=c++17` as a `CFLAGS` under Linux and macOS.

* Migration to Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and IntelÂ® oneAPI HPC Toolkit 2022.3.

* macOS: Build environment has been migrated to conda and now relies on clang and libc++, hence (existing) toolboxes with binary gateways have to be (re)compiled using the same conda environment (see https://gitlab.com/scilab/scilab/-/wikis/Developers/setup-Scilab-repository-macOS)


Packaging & Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------------------

* 32-bit Windows platforms are no more supported (no binary versions released).

* Scilab embedded JVM is Java 8. 

* To run or compile Scilab you need at least:
  - Windows (64-bit):
     - Windows 11 (Desktop)
     - Windows 10 (Desktop)
     - Windows 8 (Desktop)
  - macOS (64-bit):
     - Intel-based Mac running macOS 10.9+ (run) and 10.14+ (compile)
     - Support of macOS Monterey & Ventura added in Scilab 2023.0.0
  - Linux (64-bit):
     - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x, 7.x
     - Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS
     - Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2+, 11.x


API/ABI modification
--------------------

* `analysis` module removed.
* `scilab_setVar` function added to API.
